#### <span class="text-gray-700">Below are some projects I have delivered, including hardware product launches and quick MVP landing pages.</span>

### More Petcube

My main contribution was to direct the design effort overall facilitating people relationships while advocating for design. Under my leadership, besides Petcube Tracker, the product design team delivered numerous improvements and experiments, as well as released another new product.

### Planca Coach

Personal business exercise, a remote coaching online service.

<details class="">
  <summary class=""><span>Details</span></summary> 
  <div class="content">
    Having a passion for sports I started a profitable day 1 remote coaching experiment, hiring Olympic Ukrainian coaches and having clients both in Europe and the US.

    <SingleVideo src={PlancaLanding} caption="Simple website build with just HTML and CSS " customClass="[&>video]:aspect-video [&>video]:object-cover"/>

    I photographed myself and my friend as models for the website, hired a waiter from my hometown as a support agent, and built a backend in Notion. Doing design, code, photography, and hiring the whole project cost me around $300 to start, while a monthly subscription was $500 and the average user lifespan turned out 8 months. 

    <ImageVideo lsrc={PlancaRetouch} lalt="Before and after of states a retouched photo" rsrc={PlancaSession} caption=" 1. The most money I spent on the project was two hours of studio and the light rent. My retouching skills came in handy; 2. The main format was 1 to 1 training, but we also experimented with group training, hoping that this would attract more people."/> 

    About 1 year into the project I realized that the market didn't seem to exist and I got married, so I decided that I could build more projects in the future, but I will never have the first year of being married again and closed the project. The coaches continued to work with clients on their terms and everyone was fit and happy.
