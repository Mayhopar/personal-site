#### <span class="text-gray-700">The Petcube Tracker is a GPS tracking device designed for pets, offering real-time location tracking, virtual fencing, and activity monitoring.</span> I directed and supervised the product design of the app and marketing website.

### Introduction

Petcube, a Ukrainian company, pioneered the pet cam market, underwent an accelerator program in YC in 2016, and adopted key philosophies like 'Make something people want' and 'Build a great product and the rest will follow'.

In 2022, Petcube founders observed the pet tracker market on Amazon, the primary hardware marketplace, and identified a lack of highly-rated trackers.

The significant number of reviews indicated a demand for GPS trackers. The absence of a 5-star product presented an opportunity for Petcube to deliver a high-quality GPS tracker. Thus, the project commenced.

### Research and Wireframes

We aimed to incorporate modern tracker functionalities and learn from competitor mistakes by conducting a competitor analysis.

After evaluating competitor strengths and weaknesses, we aligned our ideas with the leadership vision.

We developed wireframes based on our current concepts, iterating ideas to improve efficiency. Subsequently, we collaborated with the CTO, CPO, and engineering team to ensure alignment between software and hardware.

### UI Design

Due to tight deadlines and detailed wireframes, I overlooked some crucial details, such as real-time and precise location display. We refined our understanding of feature importance based on user feedback.

User testing revealed flaws, prompting UI enhancements. We optimized feature placement to better align with hardware capabilities, such as displaying the dog's position. Initially, users expected exact positioning on the map, but we adjusted to indicate the dog's general area to avoid confusion.

Additionally, we adjusted UI elements to better match user expectations. We also made activating 'Lost Dog Mode' less convenient to prevent rapid battery drainage, encouraging users to reserve it for emergencies.

### Lost Dog Mode

### Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to Andriy Klen for entrusting me with this legendary Ukrainian product. Working with the exceptionally talented designer Oleh Smieltsov and having the opportunity to hire Denis Kachanovsky, a young and sharp talent, was truly enriching. I learned immensely from everyone involved in this project.
